'Richard'... on www.thebateam.org

 Syntax to use:

 mSearch "Filename.ext" "Filepath" [/Q | -Q]
                     Or
 mSearch [/? | -h | /h | Help]

 Where:
 Filename.ext	:	The name of the File to search.
 Filepath	:	The full / Relative path of the file to replace
			the previous searched file.
 '/Q' or '-Q'	:	To perform all actions in Quiet Mode
				It will not confirm before replacing...
 '/h' or '-h' or '/?':	to see this help menu...

 If file_not_found...it will return errorcode '404'
 If the path specified to file for replacing is invalid, then errorcode
 will be '1'.
 Else it will return errorcode '0'.
